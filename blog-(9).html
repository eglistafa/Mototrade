      <h1>BMW 740i Review</h1>
      <p>BMW has extended its production of the Series 7 for 45 years, but they have maintained their meticulous engineering by fine-tuning the details of their long line of predecessors. The new BMW 740i has kept up with the legacy. With a refined 3.0-liter inline-six petrol engine featuring a 48V mild hybrid system and the exceptional TwinPower Turbo technology, the manufacturers have hit the hammer with this one. The innovation has not only added to the responsive allure but also played its role in maintaining fuel efficiency and emission reduction. This all-luxury sedan boasts 300 horsepower and over 690 Nm of torque, contributing to its 155 mph top speed. Premiered in April 2022, the model continues to be popular even today, and rightfully so, given that the Series 7 seventh-model generation remains the manufacturer's most digitized and innovative creation so far. And it's not only the engine performance that has caught the eyes of the enthusiasts; the overall stability on the road and top-notch attention to comfort have definitely turned heads. Since the retail prices start at $97,000, 740i has aimed to provide the most luxurious experience at a price tag justified for this masterpiece!</p>

      <h2>Half A Century Old!</h2>
      <p>After almost half a century of BMW's flagship Series 7 passed along six generations, the German manufacturer unveiled the seventh generation in April 2022. Outrightly competing with Mercedes Benz, these feature fully electric variants for the first time in their history. The first generation was introduced in 1977, setting the benchmark with innovations such as the first electric speedometer – something clearly ahead of its time. Since then, the variants were just unstoppable, debuting the first 12V engine in the second generation, followed by the first diesel engine in the third generation. The beginning of the 19th century marked the era of further digitization with the launch of the iDrive control concept and Night Vision features in the fourth generation, revolutionized by 6-liter 12-cylinder engines, TwinPower Turbo technology, and direct petrol injection during the fifth one. 2015 marked the new era of hybrid, plug-in variants, and it wasn't until seven years later that BMW took over the world again with the premiere of their latest seventh sequel.</p>

      <h2>Ridiculously Comfortable</h2>
      <p>Under the hood, this Bavarian flagship model has maintained power and efficiency with its potent six-cylinder in-line diesel engine with the signature 48V mild hybrid technology of this generation using an electric motor integrated into the transmission. The BMW 740i is fitted with the most powerful version of the new 3.0-litre unit of all the Series 7 variants. The maximum output of 280 kW/380 hp and peak torque of 520 Nm (383 lb-ft) can be briefly boosted to 540 Nm (398 lb-ft) with the mild hybrid technology. Breaking down the combinations of this beastly engine gives a clear picture of the comfortable driving experience behind the wheel. The TwinPower turbo engine delivers a nominal 386 horsepower at 4400 rpm and 650 Nm torque at up to 2500 rpm. Switching to low-speed driving with fuel and emission optimization, the 48V mild hybrid technology comes into play with 18 hp power and 200 Nm torque. You can unleash the car at the top speed of 155 mph; in fact, the manufacturers also promise a 0-60 mph sprint in 5.6 seconds. And it only gets better with the advanced eight-speed Steptronic transmission, which explains the smooth gifts between gears. The handling of the car only inspires confidence in every way. Speaking of, the electrically-assisted all-wheel-drive system and the well-thought suspension system of the vehicle play their role all too well in this regard. Made of aluminum, the front and rear adaptive air suspension with electronic dampers save you those road bumps. Plus, the vented disc brakes are efficient, and coupled with BMW's strategic integration of brake stability systems, you can halt the roaring engine all smoothly and safely despite its 4863 lb curb weight!</p>

      <h2>Modernly Sophisticated</h2>
      <p>BMW has always caught the eye with its disruptive design. They carried their legacy of incorporating the signature kidney grille, but only the tallest and widest of any Burvarian series. Taking on the perfect opportunity with the light placement, the daylight lights look like the car's eyebrows, under which the headlights are buried inside the massive grille resembling the eyes. They all went ahead with another design element, which they called the Hofmeister, which gives the car its angular turn at the bottom of the C-pillar. The model is available in a clear paint coat, and while the front bumper is similar in shade, the rear bumper has a somewhat black fascia accent that adds to the car's visual appeal. Further contrast comes from the black side windows and the door handles. The doors are electrically powered and share an elegantly designed framework that smells like class and luxury. The surface design is rather monolithic, and the angles and curves complement each other well, giving 740i's exterior design its taut body. While the design is undoubtedly attractive, it's not just about aesthetics when it comes to Series 7. Functionality has also been the prime focus of its sophisticated design. It can be backed up with extraordinary features such as speed-sensitive rain-detecting wipers and power-heated side mirrors that use the best modern approach. The subtle yet highly strategic design of the BMW 740i is one of the first few things you will notice as you set your eyes on this piece of automotive art.</p>
