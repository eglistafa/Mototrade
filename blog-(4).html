      <h1>Acura NSX Review</h1>
      <p>The original Acura NSX was a seminal sports car of the nineties and early 2000s. Honda drew inspiration from the F-16 fighter jet and input from the Formula 1 legend Ayrton Senna to create this iconic machine. Gordon Murray, the visionary automotive designer, had acknowledged that he drew inspiration from the Acura NSX while crafting his magnum opus, the McLaren F1. More than a decade after the discontinuation of the first-generation NSX, Acura decided to revive the nameplate in 2016. The second-gen Acura NSX was a completely reimagined hybrid sports car, built anew from the ground up. Powered by an all-new 573-hp twin-turbo V6 hybrid powertrain, the new Acura NSX debuted in 2016 as a 2017 model-year car. Even while being an entirely new beast, the NSX retained its predecessor's most salient traits. Right after its inception, the 2017 Acura NSX was eulogized by enthusiasts for its cutting-edge looks, physics-defying handling, and exceptional daily drivability. The 2017 Acura NSX commanded a base price of $156,940 and its production run continued for five years until 2022. This second-generation Acura NSX review formulated by Mototrade covers everything you should know about the eminent Japanese sports car. </p>

      <h2>Reincarnation Of A Legend</h2>
      <p>The second-generation Acura NSX was created conjointly by Honda’s Japanese and American divisions. The powertrain was developed by Honda's Automobile R&D Center facility in Tochigi, Japan, while the rest of the car was designed by Honda’s R&D center in Ohio. Production of the second-gen NSX codenamed NC1 was exclusive to Honda's Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC), in Marysville, Ohio. This $70 million plant was built specifically for the NSX, while the car's hybrid powertrain was assembled separately at Honda’s engine-building facility in Anna, Ohio. Despite its relatively short production run of five years, the Acura NSX gained a handful of upgrades over the years. Two years after its inception, the 2019 model year NSX received a subtle overhaul. On the outside, the front grille was painted in a stealthier, gloss black shade. Additionally, the previously chrome-cladded nose of the NSX was replaced with a body-color hue. Acura also made adjustments to the chassis, further sharpening the agility of the agile sports car. The front and rear suspensions were further stiffened up, and Continental's SportContact 6 tires were made standard equipment. A new gleaming body color was also introduced in 2019, “Thermal Orange Pearl”, which was followed up by an equally scintillating “Indy Yellow” in 2020. For 2021, Acura installed another novel hue onto the NSX’s $1,000 heritage paint palette. It was Long Beach Blue Pearl which joined Berlina Black and the radiant Indy Yellow as a new optional shade. 2021 was the final model year of the regular Acura NSX while a beefier 600-hp Type S version was sold exclusively in 2022 as a final sendoff to the icon. According to Road & Track, roughly around 2900 units of the second-generation Acura NSX were sold globally out of which 350 were the 2022 NSX Type S.</p>

      <h2>More Functional Than Flamboyant</h2>
      <p>The interior of the second-gen Acura NSX isn’t as opulent as one would expect from a supercar priced upwards of $150,000. Sure, the leather shrouding the seats and cabin is of the finest quality and the roofliner is fabricated from exquisite Alcantara. However, you will have to bear with a slew of parts grabbed directly from lesser Honda cars, including the buttons, switchgear, and infotainment screen. Acura offered five interior color choices with the NSX, namely Indigo, Ebony, Saddle, Red, and Orchid; all of which could be paired with any of the exterior colors. The standard semi-aniline leather and Alcantara-trimmed sport seats are perforated, heated, and powered, whereas manually adjustable lightweight sport seats were a no-cost option. Additionally, Acura offered an option to upgrade to a more sumptuous Milano leather upholstery and deck out the NSX with an optional Carbon Fiber Sport Package. Overall, the NSX’s cabin is unique, plush, and sporty but with a smattering of cheapness due to the borrowed parts from lesser Acuras.</p>

      <h2>Eye-Catching Silhouette</h2>
      <p>Looking at it from the outside, the Acura NSX is a one-of-a-kind creation with a cutting-edge design that might have been a bit too futuristic for its time. However, it is a feast for the enthusiastic eye, especially the facelifted 2019-22 model years. The Acura NSX’s space frame is primarily constructed from aluminum along with steel and carbon fiber. Its signature front grille and the floating C-pillars that blend seamlessly into the rear glass are distinctive exterior facets of the Acura NSX. The side profile flaunts signature lightweight Y-spoke forged aluminum wheels of 19 inches in diameter up front and 20 inches at the rear. These came wrapped around in high-performance Continental rubber as standard, while Pirelli Trofeo R tires were an optional extra. Over the years, the NSX was offered in ten exterior paint colors including two no-cost options, and a bunch of premium and heritage shades. The optional Carbon Fiber Exterior Sport Package allowed customers to bedeck the car with a myriad of carbon fiber exterior components. On top of that, buyers also had the option to spec the NSX with a roof panel and rear spoiler crafted out of the ultra-lightweight material.</p>
