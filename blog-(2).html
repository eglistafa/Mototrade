      <h1>Aston Martin DB7 GT Review</h1>
      <p>The Aston Martin Rapide S came just three years after the first Rapide was introduced in 2010 and it wasn’t just an optional trim level, it replaced the standard version entirely. While the old Rapide was an exciting car all around, it didn’t really attract as many customers as Aston Martin had hoped for. And since redesigning the entire car was by no means a viable option, the only solution was to double down on the Rapide’s main attributes. So, the Rapide S horsepower was increased substantially among other revisions that came a year later. A thorough facelift was also included for the exterior, while the Rapide S price remained the same as it was for the standard Rapide. While all those changes didn’t do much to attract new customers, the Rapide S is an absolute gem on the used market today. This Rapide S review will highlight its main features, but also explain all of its shortcomings compared to the competitors. But before that, check out the ones currently available for sale here at Mototrade.</p>

      <h2>Last Effort To Increase Sales</h2>
      <p>When the first Aston Martin Rapide was introduced, the brand aimed to sell 2,000 cars annually. Unfortunately, because the Rapide was nowhere near bespoke or potent enough to justify its enormous price tag, those sales numbers never even came close to 2,000. That also makes for an interesting answer to where was the Rapide S made because the production was initially set in Austria. But the production of the Rapide S was switched to Gaydon because the demand was low enough. So, how many Rapide S were produced? The annual sales attained by Aston Martin were around for the first two years, while it was rumored that the production of the Rapide S would go down to 500. Since there are no official numbers, we can only assume that around 3,000 S versions were made between 2014 and 2018. For comparison, Porsche sold over 7,000 Panameras a year at the same time. The Rapide S couldn’t even come close despite retaining the same price as the older model while offering much more for the money. Now, this Aston Martin Rapide S review will explain what makes it so much better than the old Rapide.</p>

      <h2>The Rapide S Is On A Whole New Level In Terms Of Performance</h2>
      <p>The first version of the Rapide only had 477 horsepower which was on par with its competitors but lacked torque and it weighed noticeably more. As a result, the Rapide wasn’t competitive in terms of performance. However, the Rapide S horsepower and torque increased to 550 and 465 lb-ft. That took the Rapide to a whole new level as the numbers will show. The Rapide S top speed increased from 188 to 203 mph. At the same time, the Rapide S 0-60 time now stood at 4.2 seconds while the old model took nearly 5 seconds. That said, the first model year of the Rapide S used the old six speed transmission so it took 0.2 seconds more to get to 60 and the top speed was 190 mph. All later models used a new 8 speed with shorter gear ratios to improve acceleration but also fuel consumption. That said, the Rapide S weight did increase to 4,387 lbs, some 190 more than the old Rapide. But an extra 190extra will hardly be felt on such a heavy car, plus the extra performance more than makes up for it. </p>

      <h2>The Interior Received A Small Update In 2015</h2>
      <p>The 2014 model year Rapide S interior was the same interior as the standard model. And that interior was almost directly carried over from the DB9, at least the front part of it. The center console was easy to navigate with physical for virtually everything, and all the knobs were finished in beautiful polished aluminum. The gauge cluster was the centerpiece as it’s entirely finished in machined metal with the signature rev counter needle moving the opposite way. Volvo sourced navigation was folded on top of the center console, while the rear passengers enjoyed climate controls, cup holders, and headrest screens. And for the 2015 model year, the Rapide S design of the center console changed slightly to a cleaner setup and a more contemporary look. But that’s where the differences end. The rear seats were still as cramped as they ever were which was the main fault of the model. That said, the rear part of the cabin with individual bucket seats and a tall center console was as unique as it gets in a sedan even today. </p>
