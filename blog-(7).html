      <h1>Top 5 Ford Muscle Cars of All Time</h1>
      <p>Among all domestic manufacturers, Ford is one of those who can be considered the pioneers of muscle cars as we know them today. A big V8 up front, rear-wheel drive, and two doors are what make a muscle car. And while there have been many cars with a similar or the same recipe, none of them capture the essence of freedom, boldness, and raw power as well as the original ones. Naturally, some of the greatest muscle cars come from Ford and there have been dozens worthy of mentioning over the years, and even more special editions. But in this article, we will focus on the five most important ones. Those that have marked the beginnings of a new eras and remain relevant even today. That also means we will, unfortunately, fail to mention many great Ford muscle cars, but don't get mad at us because we will justify our picks throughout the article as we explore each model. But before that, if you are looking to buy a Ford muscle car, regardless of the generation, you can always find a few examples at Mototrade.</p>
      <img src="blog.foto/blog7/blog7(1).webp" alt="Bentley Flying Spur W12">
      <h2>First Generation Mustang</h2>
      <p>I know, this one is pretty obvious. We can't talk about the greatest Ford muscle cars without first mentioning the car that arguably started it all. The first Ford Mustang was made to be a fun, small, and cheap sports car making it much more similar to the Toyota GT86 today than the current Mustang. That's even more obvious when we consider that the Mustang was introduced with a pretty small and weak inline-six engine instead of a V8 like we are all used to. Regardless, the Mustang was such a hit that it sold over 400,000 units the first year which broke all previous records for an initial launch. It also surpassed Ford's expected first-year sale of 150,000 examples by over 250,000. But of course, it wasn't long before Ford began offering the Mustang with a small 4.3 liter V8, and less than a year later a 289 (4.7 L) V8 with either 225 or a respectable 275 horsepower. And while those two powertrains were impressive for a small coupe back in the day, the original Mustang could definitely handle more. So, in 1967 we got the very first Shelby Mustang GT350 and a GT500. The GT350 was a more track-oriented version with a 306 horsepower 280 V8, while the GT500 was the most powerful with a 428 V8 (7.0 L) and 355 horsepower. And so, in the span of a few years, Ford put out three icons that were so popular that they are still made today, the GT, GT350, and the GT500. And all three were based on the first generation Mustang making it arguably the greatest muscle car ever, not just from Ford.</p>

      <h2>Mustang S197</h2>
      <p>There is no denying that the SN95 Mustang is one of the greatest generations ever and it's the generation that shot the model into the future and kept it relevant as we entered the new millennium. However, the Mustang was always focused on the domestic market, until the S197 came out. The S197 marked a new era of retro-futuristic Mustang designs and that era is still ongoing nearly 20 years later. Moreover, the design of the Mustang made it more popular internationally than it ever was and it was featured in tons of movies and TV shows both domestically and abroad. Also, the GT with the old and legendary 4.6 Modular V8 made the perfect tuning platform and it was one of the cheapest V8s you could buy. All of this made it equally popular with both young and old buyers. Another great thing about the S197 is that it brought back the Shelby GT500 name after it was out of production for more than 35 years. And thankfully, after such a long time, it came with a bang. The GT500 packed a 5.4 liter, supercharged V8 based on the SVT Cobra R engine, but now with 500 horsepower. That's a substantial increase over the 385 horsepower the previous generation SVT got. All in all, the S197 turned a new page for the Mustang and is one of the main reasons the Mustang remains in production even after all of its competitors have been discontinued.</p>

      <h2>Ford Falcon XB GT</h2>
      <p>We all know just how important Ford has always been as a car manufacturer, but Ford is also a domestic car manufacturer that has by far the most presence on the international market. Many continents got their own special Fords that weren't sold anywhere else, but only Australia got their own special muscle cars. The pinnacle of those is the Ford Falcon XB GT which can in many ways be compared to the Mustang here at home. The XB GT sold like crazy for what it was, and rightfully so. Not only that, the Falcon XB has a huge cult following even today, a member of which is the famous actor Eric Bana who even shot a documentary about his Falcon and it starred Jeremey Clarkson among other guests (we highly recommend you give it a watch if you haven't). Now, there are a few reasons why the XB is so special. The first is that with the right set of wheels, it becomes one of the best-looking muscle cars ever, and the second is its highly durable 5.8 liter V8 engine. But the third reason it's so special is all its racing success. The Falcon XB GT won the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1973, 1976, and 1977, plus a few more racing championships in Australia. And lastly, the Falcon XB GT is one of the greatest automotive cinema superstars ever, if not the greatest because of course, it's the main car in the Mad Max film series.</p>
