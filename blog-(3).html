      <h1>2024 Land Rover Velar Review</h1>
      <p>The Land Rover Velar demanded everyoneâ€™s attention ever since it came out in 2017 thanks to its classy looks which made it one of the best-looking SUVs money can buy. The Velar was intended to compete with smaller premium SUVs, mainly the BMW X4, Porsche Macan, and to some degree the Mercedes GLC, and it has done that fairly successfully. Thanks to its initial success, the model got a facelift for the 2024 model year so that's what we will focus on in this Land Rover Velar review. Some of the changes include an updated interior and exterior, and an upgraded hybrid system in the P400e model. However, the Land Rover Velar horsepower ratings have remained the same for each powertrain option. That said, the 2024 Velar prices have increased somewhat, although the increase can still be considered conservative when compared to some of its competitors. But we will go into more detail as move along. Before that, if you are looking to buy a Land Rover Velar, feel free to check out the ones we have available here at Mototrade. </p>

      <h2>The 2024 Velar Looks Better Than Ever</h2>
      <p>Not much has changed on the 2024 Land Rover Velar, but then again, it is one the most stylish SUVs on the market so there was no need for any drastic changes. Even so, the exterior updates do make the Velar look more modern and even classier. On the front, the Velar gets redesigned daytime running lights that look noticeably more aggressive. At the same time, the main lights now feature 268 individual LEDs which are infinitely adjustable. The front grille also looks more sleek, even to the point where it resembles an EV, but not in a bad way. The side profile hasn't changed at all apart from new wheel designs. The rear, however, is noticeably different. New tail lights still have the same outline, but the lighting elements have been updated and, the rear bumper is redesigned and is now much cleaner than before with no unnecessary lines and creases. Overall, the Velar still looks better than most of its competitors despite receiving only a minor facelift after more than six years in production. But at the end of the day, the exterior is always down to personal preference.</p>

      <h2>The Interior Doesn't Look As Exciting As It Used To</h2>
      <p>The first Land Rover Velar interior was one of the best-looking ones on the market. It featured dual screens on the center console plus a wonderful array of buttons as well, something we are missing with every new car more and more. Unfortunately, it's the same case with the 2024 Velar interior. The dual screens are replaced by a single, 11.4-inch unit that's used as the infotainment, climate controls, and navigation. At the same time, all the center console buttons are gone. The center console now looks like it's missing a lot of content, especially when looked at next to the old Velar. That said, the interior does look much cleaner than before, and it's just following the trend set by modern EVs, mainly Teslas. On another positive note, the main screen does feature some really useful shortcuts that keep almost everything you need during day-to-day driving within two taps. Also, the Velar still offers a huge number of material options for the interior, as well as different color combinations and trim finishes. Depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can customize a Velar to almost Bentley levels of luxury.</p>
      <img src="blog.foto/blog3/blog3(3).webp" alt="">
      <h2>The Velar Still Offers a Good Number Of Different Powertrains</h2>
      <p>The powertrains in the 2024 Land Rover Velar haven't changed much compared to the older model. The entry-level powertrain is still the same 2 liter, 247 horsepower P250. The engine received no changes to auxiliary components or internals, and even the horsepower rating remains the same. The P250 engine is good for a 7.4 second 0-60 run which is nothing to brag about these days at this price point, but for most of the average driver, that's more performance than will ever be needed. Still, drivers with a heavier right foot can always go for the P400 model which gets the old 3-liter straight six pushing 395 horsepower. The straight six will push the Velar to 60 in 5.1 seconds which is very quick indeed. The P400 is also a mild hybrid that includes a 10-horsepower electric motor which helps the Velar feel a bit more lively during slow driving. However, even in the P400 trim, the Velar is slower than the BMW X4 M40i, and the Porsche Macan S, its main two rivals. And we are quite positive that the Velar won't have driving characteristics on the same level as the BMW or Porsche which means there are better options for more enthusiastic drivers. But if style as well as solid performance is what you are after, barely anything beats a Velar P400.</p>
